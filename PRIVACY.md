# Privacy Policy for PuckPulse

**Last Updated: February 19, 2026**

Ron Bierman ("we," "us," or "our") operates the PuckPulse mobile application.

## 1. Local-Only Operation
**PuckPulse is designed to operate entirely within your Local Area Network (LAN).** 

The app does not connect to the internet, nor does it communicate with any external servers, databases, or third-party services. All data (scores, team names, clock state) is transmitted directly between the mobile app and your local PuckPulse Scoreboard Controller over your Wi-Fi network.

## 2. No Data Collection
**PuckPulse does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, user data, or usage statistics.**

## 3. Permissions
To function, the app requires the following technical permissions:
- **Local Network / Multicast:** To find and connect to the PuckPulse controller on your network.
- **Networking (Technical "Internet" Permission):** Android requires this permission to establish a local connection (WebSocket) to your scoreboard controller. No data ever leaves your local network.

## 4. Third-Party Services
PuckPulse does not include any tracking, analytics, or advertising SDKs.

## 5. Contact
